- How you structure your test code:
  `i put test in same repository of app, so we dont need clone again`
- Your creativity in finding edge cases:
  `you can just refer to /e2e for scenario end to end and /ui for scenario functional`
- Your code organization and readability:
  `it can separated into base layer, page layer with pom`
